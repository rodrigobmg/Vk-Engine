# Vulkan Based Rendering Engine
*Warning*: you might not be able to clone the project if all my GitHub LFS bandwidth has been used. I have to find a solution to put assets outside of the main repository.

Toy engine project to learn Vulkan and advanced rendering techniques.

Supports Linux and Windows.

## Features:
* Abstraction layer
* Shader hot reloading
* Asset hot reloading
* Highly backward and forward compatible serialization system
* Physically based opaque surface shading
* Image based lighting
* HDR textures
* Cascaded shadow maps
* Parallax occlusion mapping with self shadowing
* Bloom
* Omnidirectional shadow maps
* Simple editor

## To explore/implement next:
* Global illumination
* Non pre-baked reflections
* Depth prepass
* Clustered forward rendering
* GTAO
* Compute shaders
* Subsurface scattering
* Volumetric clouds
* Automatic texture transition barriers
* Texture viewer
* Variance shadow maps

## Goals
* Sponza running at 155 FPS with all point lights casting shadows
